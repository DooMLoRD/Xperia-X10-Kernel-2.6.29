DESCRIPTION: Convience macros for access the cp registers in the arm.

#ifndef __mrcmcr__h_
#define __mrcmcr__h_

/*
* Define some convience macros to acccess the cp registers from c code
* Lots of macro trickery here.
*
* Takes the same format as the asm instructions and unfortunatly you cannot
* use variables to select the crn, crn or op fields...
*
* For those unfamiliar with the # and string stuff.
* # creates a string from the value and any two strings that are beside
*   are concatinated...thus these create one big asm string for the
*   inline asm code.
*
* When compiled these compile to single asm instructions (fast) but
* without all the hassel of __asm__ __volatile__ (...) =r
*
* Format is:
*
*    unsigned long reg;   // destination variable
*    MRC(reg, p15, 0, c1, c0, 0 );
*
*   MRC read control register
*   MCR control register write
*/

/*
* Some assembly macros so we can use the same macros as in the C version.
* Turns the ASM code a little C-ish but keeps the code consistant and in
* one location...

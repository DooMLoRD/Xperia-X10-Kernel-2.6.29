Haptic handling under Linux
========================

In its simplest form, the haptic class just allows control of Haptics from
userspace. Haptic appears in /sys/class/haptic/. The maximum level of the
haptic is defined in max_level file.

The interface is pretty simple - it provides oneshot mode where user
can specify duration of the effect (in milliseconds) and desired level
Of course, you can adjust the level by setting level property

# echo ${millisecond} > /sys/class/haptic/<device>/oneshot

# echo ${level} > /sys/class/haptic/<device>/level

You can also enable or disable haptics devices by manipulating 'enable' attribute:

# echo 1 > /sys/class/haptic/<device>/enable	-> Enable
# echo 0 > /sys/class/haptic/<device>/enable	-> Disable

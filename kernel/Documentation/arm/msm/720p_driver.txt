Introduction
============

This kernel driver is for the 720p video core introduced in the
7x30 SOC.  The 720p video core block is capable of encoding and decoding
of multiple streams at 30 fps upto 720p resolution image(1280x720).

Hardware description
====================

720p video core hardware and firmware in 7x30 SOC perform decoding
& encoding functions for H264,MPEG4,H263 standards.
720p video core decoder can generate YUV frames in NV12 Linear or
NV 12 TILE format.
720p video core encoder supports NV12 Linear format for encoding function.

Software description
====================

The 720p video driver uses the standard init, open, release, and exit driver
interfaces for initialization and deinitialization.
The driver uses the standard ioctl interface for performing encode and
decode operations.

Design
======

Requirements:
The driver supports the codec types defined in msm_vidc_vdec.h and
msm_vidc_venc.h.  The input and output buffers are allocated in PMEM.
The driver supports suspend/resume.

Device Node:
The driver creates device nodes /dev/msm_vidc_vdec for video decoder
and /dev/msm_vidc_venc for video encoder.

Power Management
================

720p core clocks are enabled when decoding or encoding is started and
disabled when decoding or encoding is stopped.

SMP/multi-core

Driver parameters
=================

None.

Config options
==============

The driver can be enabled and disabled by the kernel config option MSM_720P_CORE.

Dependencies
============

The 720p core driver uses the MSM clk driver to enable and disable the clock.

User space utilities
====================

720p core driver will be used by the openmax video decoder and encoder components.

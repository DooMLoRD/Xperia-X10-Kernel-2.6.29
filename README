----------

[v03a] decreased MAX cpu frequency to 1228Mhz




Changelog: (Final versions)
----------

[v03]

    * derived from zKernel 05072011:
          o kernel version 2.6.29
          o latest SE sources (2.1.A.0.492)
          o FPS cap removed
          o overclocked to 1.13GHz
          o in-call volume increased
          o full netfilter support (droid wall, wifi tether)
          o drivemapper support (2.2+ native app2sd)
          o working with basebands 54+ (67 recommended)
    * my additions:
          o confirmed to be working on all basebands (2.0.xx & 2.1.xx)
          o cpu voltage modulation:
                + S-series kernels - stock voltages
                + X-series kernels - undervolted
          o optimized frequency-voltage table
               1. added 192 Mhz frequency and unlocked frequencies from 128Mhz to 1267Mhz [for both series]
               2. further decreased voltage (improved undervolt) for many frequencies [X-series only]
          o startup/bootup frequencies set at min:245Mhz, max:998Mhz (in ramdisk)
          o CPU Governors activated/added: Interactive (the inbuilt governors have not been disabled)
          o compiled using GCC 4.4.3
          o File System support (in kernel): EXT3, EXT4, NTFS, NFS (server/client), CIFS
          o enabled access to .config through /proc/config.gz
          o enabled ARM THUMBEE extensions
          o SLAB memory allocator
          o I/O scheduler activated: CFQ, Anticipatory (the inbuilt schedulers have not been disabled)
          o enabled TUN & TAP (VPN support)
          o added init.rc tweaks (thanks to erickwill)
          o added a special verion bootlogo

[v02]

    * derived from zKernel 05072011:
          o kernel version 2.6.29
          o latest SE sources (2.1.A.0.492)
          o FPS cap removed
          o overclocked to 1.13GHz

          o drivemapper support (2.2+ native app2sd)
          o working with basebands 54+ (67 recommended)
    * my additions:
          o unlocked frequencies from 128Mhz to 1228Mhz [for both series]
          o for sake of safe booting startup/bootup frequencies set at min:245Mhz, max:998Mhz
          o cpu voltage modulation:
                + S-series kernels - stock voltages
                + X-series kernels - undervolted
          o increased voltage for frequency 1228Mhz to 1375mV [for both series]
          o decreased voltage (improved undervolt) for many frequencies [X-series only]
          o added 'Interactive' governor [for both series]
          o compiled using GCC 4.4.3
          o enabled EXT3, EXT4, NTFS file system support in kernel
          o enabled NFS (server/client), CIFS file system support in kernel
          o enabled access to .config through /proc/config.gz
          o enabled ARM THUMBEE extensions
          o changed SLAB allocator to SLUB
